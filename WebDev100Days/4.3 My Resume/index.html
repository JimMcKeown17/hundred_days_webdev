    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am the Managing Director and Co-Founder Masinyusane, a non-profit
      education organization, working in impoverished communities in the Eastern
      Cape of South Africa. My life is dedicated towards fighting poverty,
      creating opportunities for others, empowering children and youth, and
      advocating for social justice. I am always looking to create opportunities
      for others to give back, invest in children, change lives, and contribute
      towards building a world with less poverty.
