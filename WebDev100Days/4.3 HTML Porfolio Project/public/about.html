<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm trying to change the world, one child at a time.</p>

<p>
  I also love math, logic, and challenges. So working on becoming a better
  coder. Plus, I'm a bit embarrassed to have a Computer Engineering Degree and
  not be great at coding.
</p>

<p>
  Here's to everyone who believes in themselves, challenges themselves, and is
  always learning.
</p>

<p>
  Oh, lastly. I want to write a book. But I'm scared. Putting that here so I
  feel some public pressure.
